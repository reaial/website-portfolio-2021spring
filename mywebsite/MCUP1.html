        <h1> MCU Phase 1 Ranked! </h1>
        <p>
          Have you watched all the movies in Phase 1 of the MCU? </br>
          If you have then you might not want to click on the website. I have some pretty bias opinions on a majority of these films and how they ranked out for me after watching all of them several times. </br> There is a list of critera that I took into account so that it could be a little less bias, but I don't think that it helped all that much.
          </p>

            <p>
              Here is the list:
            </p>

            <p>
              This is what is taken into account for each score...
              <ul>
                <li>Comedic Relief</li>
                <li>Action</li>

                  <strong> Reasoning</strong>: For comedic reasons only the movie won. This is my favorite movie, because of how hilarious it was. Don't get me wrong the fight scences the storyline, and the graphics were done incredibly but this movie was the best one in my opinion.</br>
                  Then the action in this movie also started right off the bat. There was really no waiting on it, and no real build up to it. It only took about four minutes for things to ramp up, and they never really slowed down all that much. </br>
                  The graphics were also stellar from beginning to end. Here is a bonus clip because I loved this scene plus it shows how, great the graphics were.
                </br>
                  The soundtrack to the movie was also amazing and it became something that I looked out for every time I watched the movie. The last things was just the overall delievery of the plot at hand was done extremely well too.

                <strong>Reasoning:</strong> Although my first time watching this movie I was scared out of my shorts, because of the plot. Now that I watch it again as an older person I find this to be one of the better ones embarking on such an interesting villian, and helping create more links to the other movies of the MCU as it progresses. <br/>
                The action in this movie was also done very well, and the graphics were amazing for such an early movie as well.<br/> Here is an example of the graphics in this film <br/><h4><a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11-D7ysNUYA"target="_blank"><strong>CLICK ME!</strong></a></h4>

                  <strong> Reasoning</strong>Yea I know a cheesy way to start this out, but simply a great movie. The entire cast, and the represation that was in this movie helped it rank as high as it did. </br>The graphics in this movie also rank as high as it did.<br> Here is an example of thsoe graphics!
                  <br><h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkoYYy1EyLE"target="_blank"><h5>" I am not dead"</h5></a></h4>
                  <br>The idea and the plot was very well thought out, and very well put together. The idea that there is a type of element like Vibranium to the point where it created a beyond this world idea civilization in Africa was also compelling. I also like that the trailers did not stay consistent with the movie at all, it through me for a loop when there was a different villain then what we suspected it to be. The action in this movie also came into play in a good amount of time as well, and it was something that I loved to watch. Every fight scene got better, and each instance of tech and bit of comedy that was used helped this movie rank so high for me. I really do think that the graphics in this film were some of the better ones. The soundtrack, and the script were also very well done, and I making them learn another language was just the icing on the cake.

              <strong> Reasoning</strong> The storyline in this movie was so seamless it made for such a great way to end out this phase. The reason that I put it top 5 and not top 3 is because of how they killed off Iron Man (who is my favorite character), so I was pretty upset about that. I do think that all of the character development that was in the movie helped it not rank lower than I would have put it out of spite. Another thing that I came to the realization the other day on was that besides slight small screen cinema here and there, the first real instance of action was well over an hour into the movie. The big screen cinema that we would normally see in a movie like this did not happen until almost the very end. So, the ability to keep us intrigued in the film for so long is another reason it ranked so high. The graphics were also well done, and the attention to detail and remembering what was mentioned in the rest of the movies to finish off this phase in order to kick off another was top notch. I really do appreciate when a plan comes together and it did just that for this film.

                 </p>
                   <strong> Reasoning</strong> I do think that this movie was better off being titles Avengers 2.5. This is what it felt like every time that I watched it. The script was good, what was being portrayed in this movie also linked to Age of Ultron and really set us up for the rest of the Phase. If there were not these little details in the movie there would not have been the set up that we had for the last movies, and for the acting that we saw in each of these movies. The graphics in this movie were okay, but since this movie was supposed to be a little more upsetting than the rest that had come out I think that the pallet of colors they chose was a little darker.

                <p>
                <strong> Reasoning </strong> This movie is top 10 for one reason and one reason only. Peter Quill. It should’ve ranked higher on character development and comedy alone, but Peter messed that up. That was more of an out of context spoiler, but it was still one slightly. I really do enjoy this movie, and it made me cry the first time I saw it in the theater. The attention to detail, and the soundtrack that was used. While also the score was immaculate it really added to the depth of the movie. The graphics were awesome, and the piecing together of all the different locations that was also done very well. Having to work all these characters stories together for the first time in a film was done pretty seamlessly.

              <strong> Reasoning </strong> This movie ranked top 10 for a few reasons, although Falcon is not one of my favorites, this is when they introduced him. The other thing is that this is when Steve was introduced to the world again after being the ice. The graphics on this movie were pretty good. The way that it was set in DC for our base location was a change of pace from being set in New York, or space. Following how Hydra was still working after all this time and still implanting things that could revolt against the government was a good way of following the story line that had been established for Captain America as well.

                <strong> Reasoning </strong>The first Captain America movie, I think it ranked lower for me because of the time period that it was set in, and the color pallet that they chose to use for a good amount of the movie. Plus, to me it was a little slow, and they did not give him the credit he deserved for a while there. Although the action that was in the movie was good, and for being a background story film it was one of my more favorites to enjoy.

                <strong> Reasoning </strong> Although this is at the beginning of the movie I do think that it is one of the best lines to come out of the MCU, it was 2008 when this was released. It was the first movie to start this phase off, and one of the first lines was a jab at a social media company that was coming to an end. Since the movie was released such a long time ago, the graphics weren’t as good as some of the others are today. Still the plot holds up, a genius who is able to make something out of literally nothing, and the fact that his “superpower” is being rich, and smart makes him even better to be seen around super soldiers made it even all the better for this to be the hero they started it out with. The comedy in this movie was okay, but the plot and the very first plot twist that I remembered as a child was done very well.

                <strong> Reasoning </strong> This movie was all about how Captain Marvel came to be, and honestly it did more than that. It answered those last little questions that we had about the movies all that time. The graphics in this movie were very good, the plot was done extremely well. I think that there were a lot of things that threw me for a loop in this movie. The fact that she was really the first superhero made, the enemy that was given in the movie was also a very good plot twist, and the little bits of comedic relief were also good too. I thought that everything in this movie made it place top 10, but I am still bias to the fact that Captain Marvel could’ve handled Endgame a little better. Which is why it is not top 5 like it should be.
