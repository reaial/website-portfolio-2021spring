        <h1> MCU Phase 1 Ranked </h1>
        <p>
          Have you watched all the movies in Phase 1 of the MCU? Well I have and I want to make this website about the rankings that I would put each movie in and why.
          This is very opinonated website, because when it comes to things that are generally consumed it would be such thing. In the follwing of the website I want to
          show you the rankings that I have put the first full phase of the MCU under some ratings that I came up with on my own, and put them in the best order
          possible due to how they fell in those rankings.
          </p>

            <p>
              Here is the list:

                  <strong> Reasoning</strong>: This movie was hilarious. I do think that the reason that I ranked it at first was because it is the best one comedy wise.
                  Then the action in this movie also started right off the bat. There was really no waiting on it, and no real build up to it. The graphics were also stellar
                  The soundtrack to the movie was also amazing and it became something that I looked out for every time I watched the movie. The last things was just the overall
                  delievery of the plot at hand was done extremely well too.
