        <h1> MCU Phase 1 Ranked </h1>
        <p>
          Have you watched all the movies in Phase 1 of the MCU? Well I have and I want to make this website about the rankings that I would put each movie in and why.
          This is very opinonated website, because when it comes to things that are generally consumed it would be such thing. In the follwing of the website I want to
          show you the rankings that I have put the first full phase of the MCU under some ratings that I came up with on my own, and put them in the best order
          possible due to how they fell in those rankings.
          </p>

            <p>
              Here is the list:

                  <strong> Reasoning</strong>: For comedic reasons only the movie won. This is my favorite movie, because of how hilarious it was. Don't get me wrong the fight scences the storyline, and the graphics were done incredibly but this movie was the best one in my opinion.</br>
                  Then the action in this movie also started right off the bat. There was really no waiting on it, and no real build up to it. It only took about four minutes for things to ramp up, and they never really slowed down all that much. </br>
                  The graphics were also stellar from beginning to end. Here is an example of how great they were. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggISrFwe3KE"><strong> CLICK ME!</strong></a>
                </br>
                  The soundtrack to the movie was also amazing and it became something that I looked out for every time I watched the movie. The last things was just the overall delievery of the plot at hand was done extremely well too. This was kept as consistent as possible with the comics, and was able to bring the vision that Stan Lee had to life.

              </p>
              <p>Although my first time watching this movie I was scared out of my shorts, because of the plot. Now that I watch it again as an older person I find this to be one of the better ones embarking on such an interesting villian, and helping create more links to the other movies of the MCU as it progresses. </br>
                The action in this movie was also done very well, and the graphics were amazing for such an early movie as well.
