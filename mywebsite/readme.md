Your final project files (html, css, images, etc) should go in here. **One of those files should be called index.html**: it will become your landing page. (Otherwise, your site will land on this readme.)

You can then publish this site to the open web: just go to your repository's Settings and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and change the source from "none" to "master branch /docs folder."

This Website is for MCU fans, and those who want an insight what is the MCU. I just want to spread the love that I have for these movies, and I honestly wanted to see how I would rank them after a conversation that I had with one of my best friends who is also a marvel fanatic, we got into a couple fights on how the 23 movies should be ranked that were apart of phase 1. It just made me think, why not start a fight with more people based off of personal opinions. I hope that this site has the ability to show people who have not watched this movies just a glimpse of how awesome, and heartbreaking this entire series was. I hope that you all enjoy it, and that this can spark conversation with other friends and fans of the MCU!
