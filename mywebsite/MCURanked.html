            <strong> Reasoning </strong>I honestly still don’t know how I feel about the Ant Man movies. I do really like the idea of Paul Rudd playing Ant Man, and his delivery of the character is very well done. The representation of the quantum realm is something that is graphically done to perfection. I like the soundtrack in this movie it represents the chaos and the giddy type of character that Scott is. Almost like he was meant to be a part of the Guardians of the Galaxy. I really do think that this is also one of the funnier movies, and I appreciated all of the fight scenes that were in this movie.

            <strong> Reasoning </strong>With it being the first team up movie after almost all of these characters first movie, I really liked seeing them all together. The jokes that were in this movie were hilarious the first time and still hold  up to this day. The other thing is that even the type of technology that they showed and the graphics that were used in the movie were also fairly well done for where technology was at during that time. The soundtrack for this movie and the use of the score was great for the first team up movie, and it just got better the farther we went into it.

            <strong> Reasoning </strong>Although this movie was good. I do think that there were some areas where it could’ve been better. I feel like we followed to much of the classic trope in this movie. Where the nerd falls for the popular girl and only wants her. The other thing that I didn’t really like in this movie is how they took away some people’s jobs just because it was an alien clean up. The graphics in this movie were very crisp. I really liked the colors that they used in this movie too. This showed how Spiderman would be a light and younger character.

            <strong> Reasoning </strong>This movie scared me I’m not going to lie. This is just because of how we use AI, and in this movie it showed us the dangers of AI. Besides that one detail from my first time watching it, this movie was a really good one, and I did enjoy it. I liked the gag about Thor’s Hammer the most too, especially because it stayed consistent throughout the rest of the phase. You can see how this really played out when it came to Endgame. The introduction of Wanda, and Pietro was also very well done. I really liked the plot of this movie too and the graphics that came with it as well.

            <strong> Reasoning </strong>This movie ranked fairly low not because I didn’t like it, but more to the fact that it was not as memorable as the rest. What I did like about it, is how there is more of an insane backstory on how he became the way that he was. When I watched it for the first time I thought about how similar he was to Tony in a lot of ways. The graphics in this movie were insane. They were almost trippy when it came to one of the final scenes. I liked the color pallet that was used for this film as well. Another thing that I liked was the patterns that were formed when they were able to make dimensions.  The character development that took place during the film alone was great to see. Normally it takes characters longer, but that is not what was witnessed here.

            <strong> Reasoning </strong>For this to be the introduction of Scott Lang as Ant Man I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would. I really liked the idea that although he was a new character, the person that he was working for still had connections with our original six through Howard Stark. The other thing was the graphics in this film were very crisp. I did think that the pallet of colors they used at certain times were a little dark, but I did enjoy it. Another thing was seeing that Peggy was alive during the time of the development of the Pym particles was pretty cool as well. I also liked how they used Scott who just came out of jail to be another superhero. I just want to say that love Luis. I really wish that he had a spin off or something, but that is a personal opinion.

            <strong> Reasoning </strong>This movie honestly should have ranked way higher than this, just because of how funny it was, and the power that Quill actually holds, but I am biased. I do not like Quill after his performance in Infinity War, and probably will not be over it for a very long time. This movies graphics were really good, and honestly it gave me a star wars type of feel. I also love groot so having him in this movie as an adult was funny just to see the turn-around in the second one. Lastly I did really like the soundtrack in this movie as well. It made it all the better for them to be in space, and to be listening to music from the 80s. The actions in this movie also make it all the funnier.

            <p> Just becaue it was screamed and at the most inconvient time was this my favorite line. They should not have been under the attack that they were but since Groot does not listen or think things through it got them to this point.</p>

            <strong> Reasoning </strong>This movie was a good way to end the first phase of the MCU. The whole movie set us up for the next portion of movies that are coming out. Taking into account how much they started to talk about the multiverse. The way that they talked about his spidey senses, and how it was off since he was upset, and how it all came together at the end. Another plot twist of who the enemy was, and who wasn’t. The graphics and the detail of the film were done very well, and the plot was excellent. I really did like the whole movie, but the one thing that it was lacking was more comedy. I feel like the older films had better jokes, or it is just my raw sarcasm that is the problem.

            <strong> Reasoning </strong> I really just did not like whiplash as the villain. I honestly felt like his motives were stupid and it did not make much sense. The suit ups in this movie were also good, and I did like how Tony met Natasha for the first time in this film as well. The other thing would be the graphics which I did enjoy and I thought that they were very well done. I did think that the color pallet that was used differed on where we were in the movie so I appreciated the contrast throughout the whole thing. Lastly I enjoyed the jokes that were made in this film as well, and how much it all pivoted on Tony’s egocentric personality.

            <strong> Reasoning </strong>Although I love Thor, and Chris Hemsworth as his actor I do think that this movie ranked this low is because of how slow it was. There was very little action, and although it made sense and was probably consistent with the comics it just wasn’t that memorable. The fact that Darcy was a part of this made it all the better she was a funny character, and seeing Thor have to experience Earth was also funny. Making him become worthy again was just good for the plot and I did enjoy watching it. This just isn’t a movie that I think I have watched more than twice due to how bad it is.
