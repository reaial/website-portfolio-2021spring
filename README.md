# Project 3: Website Portfolio

 This website is my way of ranking all the MCU movies. I have watched all of these movies (besides the Incredible Hulk). I started watching these movies when Iron Man came out back in 2008 and I instantly fell in love with everything that was the MCU. I know that some of my rankings might be controversial, but I am standing by what I said, until I really watch all of them again. They are bound to change because when I go back and watch things I always find something else that I like about the movie. I hope that you enjoy my website!
