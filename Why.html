          Why isn't Justice a liberty for all like it says in our Pledge of Allegiance?
          This is a concpet that for some reason although our Forfathers wished it, it is not something that we are all able to obtain.
          Many people have worked toward this, and they want us to have the ability to have it, but this is just not something that is in the cards,
          for the African American community.
